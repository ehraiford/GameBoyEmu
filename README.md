#GameBoyEmu

The plan is for this to eventually be a cycle accurate emulator of Nintendo's GameBoy.

The goal for this emulator was to help me get better at C++ as my emulation experience has primarily been in Rust. 

This is just a nights and weekends project and is being developed alongside a reusable development GUI written in Rust so progress on it will be slow.
